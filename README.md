# python-web-bottle-tdd-api-basic-auth-mysql-chained-sql-pop

## Description
Simple web app that serves an api for a bottle project using basic auth.
Requires basic authentication for endpoints.

| username | password |
| -------- | -------- |
| *user* | *pass* |

Uses and replicate over 4 databases on the same server:
- beverage, the prod
- test_api, for remotely testing api by *testify*
- test_chained, tests strategy chained sql functions by *pytest*
- test_raw, tests strategy raw sql by *pytest*
*Note: test data should not be on same server as prod; only brevity made it necessary.*

Pytests are aggregated to a single folder, reports, and viewable with an allure server.

Uses sqlalchemy query a table `pop` using chained sql functions.
